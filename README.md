user's inputs:
- prob.m: File with the problem to be solved; defines the number of variables and constraints; calls fdata.m and faipa.m to solve
- fun.m: File with the MATLAB function that computes the Objective and the Constraints
- gfun.m: File with the MATLAB function that computes the Objective and the Constraints DERIVATIVES, if available

- faipa.m: method's algorithm
- fdata.m: input of control data defined by the user
